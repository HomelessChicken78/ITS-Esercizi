'''8-16. Imports: Using a program you wrote that has one function in it, store that function in a separate file.
Import the function into your main program file, and call the function using each of these approaches:
import module_name
from module_name import function_name
from module_name import function_name as fn
import module_name as mn
from module_name import *'''
