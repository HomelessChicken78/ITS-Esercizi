Allowed built-in functions: TBA
• Create a function that displays a number in a base system in the terminal.
• This number is given in the shape of an int, and the radix in the shape of a string
of characters.
• The base-system contains all useable symbols to display that number :
◦ 0123456789 is the commonly used base system to represent decimal numbers
◦ 01 is a binary base system ;
◦ 0123456789ABCDEF an hexadecimal base system ;
◦ poneyvif is an octal base system.
• The function must handle negative numbers.
• If there’s an invalid argument, an error should be displayed. Examples of invalid
arguments :
◦ base is empty or size of 1;
◦ base contains the same character twice ;
◦ base contains + or - ;
◦ base contains characters that are not alphanumerical (eg parenthesis or slashes are not allowed)


WHAT TO DO:
1. ask the user the input numbers
2. check if the input is correct:
2.1 check if it contains only one character
2.2 if it does not, check if there is any + or - in the string
2.3 if there are not, check if there are non-alphanumerical characters
2.3.1 
2.4 if there are not, check if any character is repeated
2.4.1
3. Ask the number in decimal
3.1 check if the number is valid. If it is not an integer, ask it again
4. Convert the number into the new base provided by the user
4.1
5. print the result!
